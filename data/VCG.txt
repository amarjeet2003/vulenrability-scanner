The class is not declared as final as per OWASP recommendations. It is considered best practice to make classes final where possible and practical (i.e. It has no classes which inherit from it). Non-Final classes can allow an attacker to extend a class in a malicious manner. Manually inspect the code to determine whether or not it is practical to make this class final.

The class variable may be accessed and modified by other classes without the use of getter/setter methods. It is considered unsafe to have public fields or methods in a class unless required as any method, field, or class that is not private is a potential avenue of attack. It is safer to provide accessor methods to variables in order to limit their accessibility.
